### Description

This project is a simple yet powerful command-line Todo List application built with Python.
It allows you to manage your daily tasks directly from the terminal—no web browser or GUI required!

The application is designed to help you:
- Add tasks quickly with a title and category,
- View all your current and completed tasks in a colored, organized table,
- Update or delete tasks easily,
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete,
- Store your todo list between sessions using a local database,
- And more, using intuitive commands!

All data is saved using an SQLite database, so your list never disappears, and the interface is made user-friendly and visually pleasing with the Rich and Typer Python libraries.
