# CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and personal projects from [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) by Harvard University.

## About the Course

CS50P is a beginner-friendly programming course that introduces students to the fundamentals of programming using Python. Topics include:

- Functions and variables
- Conditionals and loops
- File I/O
- Libraries and modules
- Regular expressions
- Object-oriented programming
- Unit testing
- Exception handling
- Web programming (brief introduction)
- Data structures in Python


> Each week's folder contains problem set solutions, organized by the assignment name.

## Completed Problem Sets

- [x] Week 0 – Functions, Variables, and Statements
- [x] Week 1 – Conditionals and Loops
- [x] Week 2 – Functions and Arguments
- [x] Week 3 – Exceptions and File I/O

## Final Project

In the `final_project` folder, I developed a small Python project as a culmination of what I learned in the course. You can find more details in the project’s own README.

## My Takeaways

This course helped me:

- Understand core programming logic and syntax using Python
- Build real-world, terminal-based applications
- Get introduced to concepts like OOP, testing, and working with files
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
